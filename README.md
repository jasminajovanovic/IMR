## Team Members:

## Project Description:

An investigation of Infant Mortality Rates (IMR) in the United States and the associated factors. 

## Research Questions to Answer:

1) Where is IMR the highest?
2) Is there a correlation between poverty and IMR?
3) Do different races experience different levels of IMR?
4) How does the education level of the mother relate to IMR?
5) Does the age of the mother play a role in IMR?
6) Does having health insurance lower the rate of IMR?

## Datasets Used:

(not sure if we want to list every single dataset we pulled, or something like "we got data from the CDC")

## Questions - Answered

1) Where is IMR the highest?

2) Is there a correlation between poverty and IMR?

*Poverty and IMR have a postive correlation.

6) Does having health insurance lower the rate of IMR?

*There is no correlation between overall rates of being insured and IMR.
*However, there is a positive correlation between having public health insurance and IMR.

## Conclusions

*The counties with the highest IMRs are in the southern and eastern United States.
*The factors with the strongest correlations with IMR are x, y, and z.
*In addition to the above factors, there appears to be a strong racial component in IMR which deserves further examination. 

## Suggestions for Further Study

*Examine racial differences in terms of rates of public versus private health insurance
